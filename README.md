## Description
Simple notebook for taking Google Analytics session data and 'flattening' out the row entries into its own data set and a summarized data set in Parquet, written to a data lake.  

Generic sample of session data included. This does not represent what would be a large returned data set from Google analytics API query and rather a single file from what could 
paginated results to be summarized and/or aggregated together.
